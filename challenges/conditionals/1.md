# Description

1. Write a JavaScript program that checks if a number (e.g., 15) is positive. If it is positive, log "Positive".
2. Use an if-else statement to check if a number (e.g., -4) is positive or negative. Log "Positive" or "Negative" accordingly.
3. Extend the above program to check if a number (e.g., 0) is positive, negative, or zero. Use an if-else-if statement to log "Positive", "Negative", or "Zero".

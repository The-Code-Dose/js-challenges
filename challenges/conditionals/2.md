# Description

1. Write a JavaScript program that checks if a person is eligible for a discount. A person is eligible if they are a member of the "Premium Customer" club and have made purchases over $500. Use nested if statements to determine this.
2. Determine if a year (e.g., 2024) is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is divisible by 400. Use logical operators (&&, ||) in your conditional checks.
3. Use a switch case to log the name of the day based on a number (1-7, where 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, etc.).

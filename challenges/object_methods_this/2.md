# Description

1. Create an object called `bankAccount` with properties `balance` and `transactions`, and methods `deposit` and `withdraw`.
2. The `deposit` method should take `amount` as argument and add it to the `balance` and add a new transaction to the `transactions` property with the type "deposit" and the `amount`. For example, here's what a transaction looks like: `{ type: "deposit", amount: 100 }`
3. The `withdraw` method should take `amount` as argument and subtract it from the `balance` and add a new transaction to the `transactions` property with the type "withdrawal" and the `amount`. For example: `{ type: "withdrawal", amount: 100 }`

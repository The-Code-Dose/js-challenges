# Description

1. Using compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`), perform and log the following operations on a variable `a` starting with 10: add 5, subtract 3, multiply by 2, and divide by 4.
2. Write a program that compares two variables, `a` (10) and `b` (20), using all comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) and logs the results.
3. Use logical operators to determine if a variable `age` (25) is between 18 and 60, including both limits. Log "Valid age" if true, otherwise "Invalid age".
4. Use the ternary operator to check whether a number (e.g., 15) is divisible by 2. Log "Even" if it is, otherwise log "Odd".

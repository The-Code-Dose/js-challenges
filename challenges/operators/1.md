# Description

1. Declare two variables with string values. Concatenate them and print the result.
2. Write a JavaScript program to calculate the sum, difference, multiplication, and division of two numbers (e.g., 8 and 4).
2. Use the modulus operator to check if a number (e.g., 7) is odd or even. Log "odd" or "even" to the console.
3. Declare a variable `x` with initial value 8. Increment this value by one using the increment operator, then decrement it by one using the decrement operator. Log the result after each operation.

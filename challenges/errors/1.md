# Description

1. Write a JavaScript program that attempts to parse an invalid JSON string using `JSON.parse()`. Use a `try-catch` block to handle the error and log a custom error message.
2. Extend the above program to include a `finally` block that logs "Operation completed" regardless of the result.
3. Write a function that calculates the square root of a number. If the input is negative, throw a custom error saying "Negative error is not allowed".

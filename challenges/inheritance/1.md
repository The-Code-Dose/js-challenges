# Description

1. Create a `Shape` class with properties `color` and `name`, and methods `getArea()` and `getPerimeter()` that logs to the console that they are not implemented.
2. Create a `Rectangle` class that extends `Shape`, with additional properties `length` and `width`, and overrides the `getArea()` and `getPerimeter()` methods to return the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
3. Create a `Circle` class that extends `Shape`, with additional property `radius`, and overrides the `getArea()` and `getPerimeter()` methods to return the area and circumference of the circle.

# Description

1. Write a `for` loop that iterates over an array of names (`['john', 'kelly']`) and prints each name to the console.
2. Use nested `for` loops to generate and log a 5x5 multiplication table.
3. Create a `for` loop that skips even numbers from 1 to 20 using the `continue` statement and logs only odd numbers.

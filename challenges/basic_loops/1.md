# Description

1. Write a JavaScript program that uses a `for` loop to log numbers from 1 to 10.

2. Use a `while` loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

3. Implement a `do-while` loop that repeatedly prompts the user for a number until the number is less than 10. Then, log that number to the console.


4. **Break in While Loop:**
   - Use a `while` loop to sum numbers from 1 to infinity, but break the loop when the sum reaches or exceeds 1000. Log the final sum.

5. **Advanced Array Manipulation:**
   - Given an array of integers, use a loop to find the largest number. Enhance it by ignoring negative numbers using the `continue` statement.

6. **Prime Number Finder:**
   - Write a program that uses loops to find all prime numbers between 2 and 100. Log each prime number to the console.

### Example Solutions for Beginner Exercises

1. **Basic For Loop:**
   ```javascript
   for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
       console.log(i);
   }
   ```

2. **While Loop Usage:**
   ```javascript
   let sum = 0;
   let i = 1;
   while (i <= 100) {
       sum += i;
       i++;
   }
   console.log("Sum of 1 to 100 is: " + sum);
   ```

3. **Do-While Loop Practice:**
   ```javascript
   let number;
   do {
       number = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number greater than or equal to 10"), 10);
   } while (number >= 10);
   console.log("You entered: " + number);
   ```

These exercises provide a solid basis for practicing loops in JavaScript, catering to different levels of programming skill. They will help you master the control flow in programming, making you better prepared for developing more complex and efficient algorithms.

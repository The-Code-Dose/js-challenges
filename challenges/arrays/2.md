# Description

1. Use a for loop to iterate over an array of numbers (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) and log each number multiplied by 2.
2. Demonstrate the use of array.push(), array.pop(), array.shift(), and array.unshift() methods with an array of your choice, explaining what each method does.
Using array.slice() and array.splice():
3. Given an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], use slice to create a new array that excludes the first and last element. Then use splice to remove the second and third elements from the original array and log both arrays.
